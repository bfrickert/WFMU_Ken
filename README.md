# WFMU_Ken
If you've ever wanted to create a Ken Freedman playlist, this may just be the project for you!

###Scraping
1. Run `python py/GetKensPlaylists.py`
2. Run `python py/GetKenSongs.py`
3. Run `python py/nltk_ken.py`
4. Your playlist will appear in `data/playlist.tsv`.
Could this all be one function? Sure. We'll get there.

But first, I'd like to make this project more versatile, to generate playlists for other DJ's. Like I said, we'll get there.
